American Red Cross
The "Text Haiti" campaign for the American Red Cross illustrated a call for help from those that needed it most, the survivors. The campaign gave a voice to the Haitian people in a very simple way. Through a text. A single question was asked, "What would a Haiti earthquake survivor text, if they could?"
