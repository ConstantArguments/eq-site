Mutant Vehicles

Notorious P.I.G.
Someone needed to bring a pig to wallow in the mud. After six months, 60 hours and a nearly exploded garage later, Burning Man bore witness to the ultimate road hog—the Notorious P.I.G. Blood, sweat and tear’d from scratch, this hog-hog was the product of pure and simple curiosity. Over the course of six months, I taught myself welding, bovine electrical therapy, hairstyling, motorcycle mechanics and problem-solving on a grand scale.

Dragon Boat

Making a spectacle at Burning Man still needs to make sense, so building a Dragon Boat seemed logical. The only creature able to survive a barren lake basin would, naturally, be a dragon. Six months, 40 hours and one giant papier-mâché dragon head later, the Dragon Boat was born. Hand-painted, hand-crafted and handled completely from scratch, the Dragon Boat is a reminder of the brilliance of adaptability.
