Vans is the original action sports footwear company rooted in authenticity and creativity. They invited me to join in on the action. Here's some of the campaigns i worked on with the crew.<!--just a p about vans section-->

Duct Tape Festival
The Vans Duct Tape Festival is a one-day beach festival that showcases four undisclosed pro surfer/shapers creating surfboards for a one-day beach festival to surf & share with local communities. This is a day to try these creations, talk to the shapers/surfer, bring your own designs to the event and celebrate creativity. The undisclosed surfer/shapers were Dane Reynolds, Alex Knost, Wade Goodall and Nathan Fletcher. The result was an amazing day at the beach and lot’s of smiling motivated kids.<!--caption for image-->

Created both long & short form for multi platform. <!--caption for surf video-->

Vans needed a unique holiday window experience that no other brand can recreate, one that catches the eyes of passerby. We teamed up with artist Jay Howell to create the world first Van Doren Workshop. This window includes motion activities, 3D illustration and various product display platform.

Inspired by Vans athletes’ request for a shoe that takes versatility, comfort and fit to a new level.
