Eric's Spaghetti Diagram
When World War II fighter planes, spaghetti and forty years of family vacations get together, they make for a glorious piece of machinery. Coming into possession of a down-on-her-luck 1972 camping trailer, I needed to teach myself the art of electrical wiring before I could roast marshmallows. Since the trailer is made out of vintage war plane materials, I designed the circuitry around WWII-era technology, and three months and 20 hours later, Hugo La Puente was rewired with a super-low maintenance, super-low power consumption system. We’re camping back to the future.
