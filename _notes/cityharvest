City Harvest
"USE THE UNUSED"
2011 One Show Student Merit Winner
Integrated Branding Campaign

City Harvest is a non-profit organization that fights hunger in New York City by rescuing unused food from local restaurants. We built our campaign strategy on this core idea by making use of unused space.

Yankee & Rockefeller Farm
In an effort to "use the unused" and promote City Harvest, we have turned two of the most iconic New York attractions into a grid of sustainable working crops. This will take place during the off season.

Terrarium Booth
In order to raise awareness of City Harvest, we have transformed phone booths across the five New York boroughs into Terrarium booths, a tool to promote healthy food and healthy eating in low-income areas.
