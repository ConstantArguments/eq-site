This is my first attempt at making a web site.

I studied for a week using W3Schools.com and Lynda.com.

I then attempted this project. There is a lot I would do better, but it was a good learning experience. 

I have not refactored this project,  nor have I tested this on any devices besides the computer it was created on.

Some of the individual page Stylesheets are abandoned (but not deleted) for a combined Stylesheet.

JavaScript should be put into its own file. 

I was advised to leave the project as is to show how much I  was able to learn in the short amount of time.

Thanks for looking at this project.
